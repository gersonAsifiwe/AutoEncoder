# AutoEncoder

This repository contains the implementation of denoising and dimensionality reduction autoencoder models using PyTorch for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The autoencoder models are trained to remove noise from input images, enhancing robustness and generalization through noise removal and feature extraction.
